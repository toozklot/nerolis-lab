# Neroli's Lab - Frontend

The frontend is written in Typescript with [Vue.js 3][vue.js] and [Vuetify 3][Vuetify].

## Setup

If you'd like to be able to log in locally please set up a .env file in the frontend root with any of the following:

- VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='\<your google client id\>'
- VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID='\<your discord client id\>'
- VITE_PATREON_CLIENT_ID='\<your patreon client id\>'

You will also need to run the backend and the database locally, for more information on setting up cloud providers, the backend and database—please refer to our [backend documentation](./backend.md)

## Running the frontend in development mode

Every time a file in the folder is saved, the frontend will be automatically recompiled and restarted using [Vite][Vite].

### Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

This script cleans, compiles and starts the development server.

### Run all automated tests locally

```
npm run test
```

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to the frontend component, please follow these guidelines:

### Components

- **Use Composition API** - While most of the components are in Options API, we want to transition to Composition API
- Split reusable functionality into separate components or composables
- Move Typescript-heavy logic, such as API request handling, to separate .ts services

### Styling

- **Follow Vuetify design patterns** - Prefer Vuetify components where possible
- **Consistent theming** - Use theme variables and maintain visual consistency
- **Responsive design** - Ensure components work well on different screen sizes, the smallest we aim to support is 320px
