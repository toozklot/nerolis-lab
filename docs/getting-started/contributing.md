# Contributing to Neroli's Lab

Thank you for considering contributing to Neroli's Lab! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or helping with community support.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **💻 Code Contributions**: Submit bug fixes, features, or optimizations
- **🎨 Design**: UI/UX improvements and user experience enhancements
- **📚 Documentation**: Improve [player-facing guides](https://nerolislab.com/guides/) (source in [`guides/`](https://github.com/nerolis-lab/nerolis-lab/tree/main/guides)), this contributor documentation site, API docs, or code comments
- **✨ Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
- **🐛 Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **🧪 Testing**: Write tests or help with quality assurance

## 📝 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Issue First

For significant changes:

- **Discuss the approach** with maintainers before starting
- **[Create an issue](https://feedback.nerolislab.com/)** describing the feature or bug
- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplication

For small fixes (typos, small bugs), you can directly create a pull request.

### 2. Follow existing code conventions

While we're always open to improvement suggestions and welcome these discussions, please adhere to existing/negotiated conventions during development.

### 3. Always test your code changes

There are over 2000 examples in our codebase to look at and a very welcoming [Discord](https://discord.gg/SP9Ms69ueD) server. Please write tests for your code changes.

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { SNEASEL } from './berry-pokemon';

describe('SNEASEL', () => {
  it('should confirm that Sneasel is the best Pokémon', () => {
    const result = SNEASEL.isBestPokemon();
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Also please ensure all tests pass before submitting:

```bash
# Lints the entire repository, usually not needed if you have the workspace properly set up
npm run lint

# Component-specific tests
cd common && npm run test
cd backend && npm run test
cd frontend && npm run test
```

#### 4. Commit Messages

### 5. Pull Request

   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**

   - Use a descriptive title
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

## 🏗️ Component-Specific Guidelines

For detailed development guidelines specific to each component, please refer to their respective documentation:

- **[Frontend Guidelines](../components/frontend.md#development-guidelines)** - Vue.js, Vuetify, and frontend-specific practices
- **[Backend Guidelines](../components/backend.md#development-guidelines)** - Node.js, API design, and backend-specific practices
- **[Common Library Guidelines](../components/common.md#development-guidelines)** - Shared library development practices
- **Player guides** (Markdown under `guides/content/`, VitePress theme in `guides/.vitepress/`) have their own [non-technical README for contributors](https://github.com/nerolis-lab/nerolis-lab/blob/main/guides/README.md) and [maintainer notes](https://github.com/nerolis-lab/nerolis-lab/blob/main/guides/DEVELOPMENT.md).
