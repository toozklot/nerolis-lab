# Sleep Sessions and Napping Explained

## Understanding Sleep Sessions

To understand a sleep session, we need to understand **Sleep Score** because it determines everything.

**Sleep Score = (Hours Slept in Session / 8.5) x 100**

- Rounded to the nearest whole number and capped at 100, so 8h28m to 8h30m gets you a full score.
- Hours slept begin from when the game determines you have fallen asleep and end when it determines you've awoken. These timings may not match the time you start and stop tracking.
  - The game decides that you have fallen asleep when you first enter Slumbering, which takes 5 minutes minimum, and that you have awoken at the end of your last Snoozing.
  - Leaving your phone motionless on a nightstand for at least 5 minutes (15 minutes to be safe) at the start and end of your sleep can ensure your sleep time is fully counted.
- There must be 90 minutes minimum between the time you start and stop tracking, otherwise the session is discarded, as if it were never tracked. The hours slept may be less than this.

During your sleep research, your Sleep Score will be used to calculate the next important number, **Drowsy Power (DP)**.

**DP = Sleep Score x Snorlax Strength**

- Snorlax Strength is locked at the start of the sleep session.
- Higher DP allows for more Pokemon to show up in your sleep session, ranging from 3 to 8 regular spawns in a single session.
  - The thresholds for spawn counts vary by map, send `-monranges` in <#1133112483054354593> to see the numbers.
  - Pokemon incense and Good Camp Ticket (GCT) add additional spawns on top of this. During New Moon Day (NMD), Darkrai may also show up as an additional spawn. The maximum number of potential spawns in a single session is 11.
- Every sleep style is added to the spawn pool at a certain rank and costs a certain amount of DP to spawn. This cost is known as DP Requirement (DPR). Rarer sleep styles generally unlock at a higher rank and have higher DPR.

## You should absolutely not be napping early game

After you complete your sleep research, the Pokemon in your team will gain EXP equal to your Sleep Score and recover energy equal to your Sleep Score, but not exceeding 100% energy total.

- Energy and EXP natures impact the energy and EXP gains, respectively, for that individual Pokemon.
- Energy Recovery Bonus increases the energy gained by the whole team by 14% and allows the Pokemon with the subskill to reach up to 105% total energy from sleep. Multiple of this subskill stack additively but the total energy does not increase beyond 105%.
- Sleep EXP Bonus increases the EXP gained by the whole team by 14%. Multiple of this subskill stack additively.

You also receive Sleep Points equal to your Sleep Score (+100 bonus Sleep Points once a day if you have the Premium Pass).

## Two Sleep Sessions

Now that we know how a single sleep session works, we can go over a few rules for when you register two sleep sessions in a single day.

- You cannot register more than two sleep sessions a day.
- The day starts at 4 AM. The time that you begin tracking your sleep determines what day the sleep session counts for, not the time that the game decides you have fallen asleep.
  - Example: If you start tracking your sleep at 3:50 AM but fall asleep at 4:10 AM, the session will count for the previous day.
- You must use your Bonus Biscuit in your first sleep session of the day. If you try to leave the catching screen without using it, it will be given to a random Pokemon.
- The combined Sleep Score for both of your sessions cannot exceed 100.
  - Example: If your first session's Score is 30, then your second's will be capped at 70 even if it is 8.5 hrs long.
  - If your first session's Score is 100, you will be allowed to track a second session but you will see no Pokemon and get no benefits from that session.

Tracking two sleep sessions in a day is referred to as **napping**.

## Benefits of Napping

Regardless of your Snorlax Strength, you can see more spawns in a single day by napping than you can with only a single session.

Napping can provide some midday energy recovery if your Pokemon are low on energy.

## Downsides of Napping

If your first session is too short, you will see generally worse spawns and fewer new sleep styles unless you have a very high Snorlax Strength. If your first session's spawns don't include anything you want to catch, then your Bonus Biscuit will be wasted.

**Your second sleep session will not have a Bonus Biscuit, so catching Pokemon in this session will be costly and difficult.**

If your first sleep session is too long, your second sleep session may not fully recover your team's energy. Without other energy recovery (E4E, Recovery Incense, recovery subskills/nature, etc.), you'll have to go the next day with lower energy than normal.

Every Pokemon after your 10th spawn of the day will give decreased candy, Research EXP and Dream Shards.

## When to Nap

The main reason to nap is to see more spawns. This can be during an event where a Pokemon you want is boosted, when you want to hunt a specific lower DPR Pokemon or when you want to find shinies.

Another use for napping is when your DP is too high later in the week and you are seeing mostly evolved Pokemon. Splitting your Sleep Score and lowering your DP will provide more more early-form spawns worth catching, with the trade-off of new sleep styles and more Dream Shards and Research EXP.

Pairing a low DP nap (preferably 3 spawns) with a high pip Pokemon incense and a Friend incense maximizes the chance that the Friend incense affects the incense Pokemon.

**Napping with the intention of catching Pokemon will be very costly for your biscuits**. Make sure you have a biscuit stockpile and have planned for the rest of the month.

- This doesn't apply to shiny hunting as you only need one biscuit to catch shinies.

\_ \_
Napping can also disrupt your Sleep Consistency score and the associated Handy Candy rewards at the end of the week. These are based on the longest sleep of each day, so if you want to preserve your Sleep Consistency score, be sure to keep this consistent.

## Tools for Napping

- [Nitoyon's Sleep Research Calculator](https://nitoyon.github.io/pokesleep-tool/) - Helps you plan how long your sleep sessions should be to maximize the total daily spawns.
- [Raenon's Pokemon Sniper](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/spawn/pokemon) (**Paid Tool**) - Determines the DP sweet spot that will maximize your chances of seeing a specific Pokemon. You can then adjust your nap length to get as close to that DP as possible.

## Manual Sleep Entry

Sleep sessions can be manually entered through the Add Sleep Data button on the Main Menu. A session input this way is treated the same as a regular sleep session except you see no Pokemon and, as a result, get no candy, Research EXP or Dream Shards. Pokemon on your team when you input the session will not gain EXP but will recovery energy equal to the Sleep Score and be given an number of hours slept equal to the session's length, which can be 12 hrs maximum. You will not receive Sleep Points equal to this session's Sleep Score but you will get 100 bonus Sleep Points if you have Premium Pass.

You can only input a sleep session within the past 30 hours. It will count towards the day the starting sleep time falls in, not the day you are inputting the session. You can only input your first sleep session for that day and it cannot be before a sleep session you've already tracked. If you do not track a second sleep session that day, your next normally tracked sleep session will have an extra Bonus Biscuit.

The main use for this is entering a sleep session after you miss tracking sleep one day. There is not much potential to take advantage of this for additional gain.

## Sleep Session Numbers

If you hit Slumbering within a certain period of time (presumably first half of your sleep):

- Sleep start = start of first Slumbering
- Time to fall asleep = start of first Slumbering
- Sleep end = end of last non-Dozing
- Sleep type = normal calculation

If you don't hit Slumbering within a certain period of time:

- Sleep start = start of tracking
- Time to fall asleep = 0 minutes
- Sleep end = end of last non-Dozing
  - If 100% Dozing = end of tracking
- Sleep type = Balanced

Hyper Dozing after the game decides your sleep has started will instantly end your sleep. <:MawileWave:1377197913519951964>
